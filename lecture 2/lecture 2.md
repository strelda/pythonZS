notebooks
    - debug *finding divisors.py* and rewrite it slowly to *finding divisors - final.py*
    - show debugging using LLM, copy paste some code and ask for explanation
    - draw Euclic algorithm on a board, be slow
    - show doctest interactively on concatenation
let them solve lots of problems and go among them
    - problems are written with process, should be fine

python3 lecture\ 2/concatenation.py produces nothing, we need verbosing mode -v

give solutions to tasks only up to the point where the majority got

2 tasks, one for 7 the other for 14 days, because now you need to practice a lot (check and confirm this before the lecture)
