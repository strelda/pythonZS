This is a slowdown lecture. Interactive programs are not so important for us, so advanced students can play with it and the rest will finish the problems from the last week.

what will we learn

notebooks
lots of problems + continue on problems from the last week
    - demonstrate wishlist on the first task
    - realize that now we represent the temperature as number, but it would be better to represent it as some datatype Temperature to be safe. We will learn this the following lecture.

They had two homeworks last week, because the following lecture will not help them here
There will be no homework next week.
    - two tasks for two weeks:
        P1M: K-tý největší prvek
