what we will learn today
GPTs:
- you should not need GPTs for now, it is good to learn the basics from documentation, for complex problems they will get handy soon
- don't cheat, you are here willingly, better to cheat by discussion with your friends or in the worst case, let the GPT explain it if you are lost (socratic method, recommend Khan academy book)

ask me during the tasks to explain anything, it is easy to get lost during the explanation

notebooks 
    - live show VS Code
    - write traffic_light as mentioned in 6 in front of them
